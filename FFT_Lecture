 Lecture 18, FFT Fast Fourier Transform


A basic Fourier transform can convert a function in the time domain
to a function in the frequency domain. For example, consider a sound
wave where the amplitude is varying with time. We can use a discrete
Fourier transform on the sound wave and get the frequency spectrum.

It has a lot of the Data.
